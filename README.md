im scared

Update: I am less scared!

This was my final assignment for the CSS section of The Odin Project's Foundations course and while I struggled, cried, and tried to escape it, I learned some nifty tricks when I forced myself to work on it. 

This is the beginning of my coding journey! It isn't perfect, but it's completed, and it'll serve as a foundation (I get it now) for things to come.

With any luck I'll look back on this in a year and marvel at how much progress I've made.

Thank you, The Odin Project!
